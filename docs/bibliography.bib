abstract = {The new Mie-scattering calculation is a robust and efficient algorithm used to compute light scattering from spheres. It calculates the ratio between Riccati-Bessel functions instead of the complicated logarithmic derivative. The Kapteyn inequality is used to estimate the number of significant digits of the calculated Riccati-Bessel functions and their ratio. This new algorithm is stable and accurate for both large and small particles. The implemented C$+$$+$ code yields the same accurate results for both small and large particles compared with Wiscombe's MIEV0 code in double precision. Suggestions are provided for the porting of the MIEV0 code.},
